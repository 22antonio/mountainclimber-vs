# How to run the game                                                                                                
1. Under releases choose the appropriate version of the game either for linux or for windows                         
2. You'll get a zip file that will need to be decompressed.                                                              
           2L. For linux you should be able to extract this automatically                                                       
           2W. For windows you'll need to download something like winrar in order to extract the files                      
3L. For linux you'll probably need to give it permissions to run 
           so click on the file named MountainClimber-VS.x86_64 > file properties > give execution permissions
           Alternatively, it can be done through the command line with 'chmod 777 <MountainClimber-VS.x86_64>'
3W. For windows you're good to go. Click on the MountainClimber-VS executable file                                   
4. Enjoy the game :)

A competitive split-screen multiplayer auto scrolling platformer, drawing inspiration from classic platformers like Super Mario as well as head-to-head competition featuring disruption similar to Puyo Puyo Tetris.
