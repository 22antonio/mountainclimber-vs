# How to run the game 
### First
Under releases choose the appropriate version of the game either for linux or for windows                         
You'll get a zip file that will need to be decompressed.
> 1. **(Linux)** For linux you should be able to extract this automatically                                                       
> 2. **(Windows)** For windows you'll need to download something like winrar in order to extract the files

### Running the Game
> 1. **(Linux)** For linux you'll probably need to give it permissions to run so click on the file named MountainClimber-VS.x86_64 > file properties > give execution permissions. Alternatively, it can be done through the command line with 'chmod 777 <MountainClimber-VS.x86_64>'
> 2. **(Windows)** For windows you're good to go. Click on the MountainClimber-VS executable file                                   

## Enjoy the game :)
